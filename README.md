# mcds - Magnetic Component Design Suite

Start with `transformerDesign.m` and follow the guided process to design an optimized transformer.

Implements state-of-the-art analytical design equations, and requires as few MATLAB toolboxes as possible:
- Robust Control Toolbox v6.7
- Signal Processing Toolbox v8.3
- Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox v11.6

Makes use of modified versions of `litzopt.m` and `coreloss.m` from Dartmouth University.
Makes use of the Struve01 package from MathWorks File Exchange.
